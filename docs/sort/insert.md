### Insert Sort

#### Description 

This is a sorting algorithm that compares and switches elements of an array in descending or ascending value

#### Process 

- loop through the whole array
- from index 1 if array starts at index 0 compare previous and current values
- switch the values relative to the comparison
- continue itteration but after each switch check with all previous values before moving on 

#### Discoveries 

- outer loops are only for progres in the left to right while itterating 
- using only one loop creates a terminating itteration after the second index. meaning only two values switch if there is a switch
